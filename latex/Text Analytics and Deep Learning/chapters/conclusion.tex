\section{Conclusions and future work}
In this work, we implement a pipeline to classify distinct topics based on semi-automatic evaluation of the party manifestos. To do so, we use LDA, LSI, and HDP, with LDA being particularly effective in our domain. For the final classification we use BERT embeddings. The results are not always perfect, but given that no data set with evaluated topics was used, they are quite reasonable.
In the future, it will be possible to extend this pipeline to a fully automatic evaluation by using labeled data. In addition, the topics can also be differentiated into high granular topics and possibly also into a hierarchical representation. 
Besides that, for a neutral perspective on the topics, an extension that fully anonymizes the results would be beneficial for our interface, as the texts should not reveal the party from which they originally come.
Furthermore, our web interface can be extended with other useful processing methods such as a question-and-answer function in the form of a chat.  
This should allow a flexible and user-friendly way to interact with party manifestos.
